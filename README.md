# Diatomic HF in Jupyter notebook

This notebook shows an example of simple code calculating HF for diatomic molecules. This code was translated from FORTRAN code provided in the book of Attila Szabo & Neil S. Ostlund "Modern quantum chemistry: introduction to advanced electronic structure theory".

The code can be run in local Jupyter environment, or in binder
